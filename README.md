# Caethan's UnReal World self-sufficiency mod

This is a set of modifications for the freeware roguelike game [UnReal World](http://www.unrealworld.fi/) developed by Sami Maaranen and Erkka Lehmus.

Last updated with UnReal World 3.40 b1.

This updates some current items, adds new buildings and crafts, including birch bark crafting, ironworking, and weaving, and also updates the in-game encyclopedia with information and pictures about the new items.


# Changes from vanilla

## Updates to Current Items

* Slender trunks replaced with staffs for several recipes.  This allows staff quality to affect the final item quality, enabling you to build high quality items with some effort.
	- Grainflail
	- Ski stick
	- Sesta
* [noquality] added for some ingredients of fixed quality to avoid negatively impacting finished quality:
	- Wooden cup & bowl: block of wood
		- skill adjustment changed from +20% to -20% to compensate
	- Wooden shovel: block of wood
		- skill adjustment changed from +10% to -30% to compensate
	- Wooden stake & staff: Slender trunk
		- skill adjustment reduced by 40% each to compensate
